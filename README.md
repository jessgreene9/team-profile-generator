## Description

This application is a Node.js command-line application that prompts the user to select between different employee roles then takes the user through various questions depending on the type of employee's profile they are completing at that time. After the user is done selecting and entering employees, they can select the option for "no more employees to add". At this point, a team.html is generated into the output folder with all information that was entered into the terminal. The user can also run npm test in order to check that the program meets all of the requirements.
